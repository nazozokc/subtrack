description: How subtrack stores data, database location, backup and restore.

## Database location

All subscription data is stored in a single SQLite database file at:

```
~/.config/subtrack/subtrack.db
```

The database is created automatically on first use. No database server or configuration is required.

## Database structure

Eight tables — three for subscriptions with a many-to-many relationship, plus tables for LLM API usage tracking, free trials, price change history, subscription suggestions, and the audit log:

### Contract, vendor & discount fields

`contract_start` / `contract_end` store contract dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `auto_renewal` stores whether the subscription renews automatically, `vendor_name` / `vendor_url` record the vendor, `plan_tier` the plan name, and `discount_amount` + `discount_type` (`percentage` or `fixed`) any active discount. Set them with `subtrack add` / `subtrack edit` flags such as `--contractEnd`, `--vendorName`, or `--planTier`. `subtrack list --contract --vendor` shows them as extra columns, and `subtrack review` surfaces upcoming contract expirations.

### Suggestions

The `suggestions` table stores candidate subscriptions detected by the scanner or imported with `subtrack receipt`. Each row moves through `pending` → `added` (accepted via `subtrack suggest add <id>`) or `pending` → `dismissed`.

### Config-backed data

Some data lives in `~/.config/subtrack/config.json` rather than the database: saved filter profiles (`profiles`, `activeProfile`), reusable templates (`templates`), budgets, and display settings. See the [Configuration](/configuration) page.

### Status

Each subscription has a `status` field: `active`, `paused`, `cancelled`, or `archived`. Only active and paused subscriptions are included in payment calculations and upcoming bills. Archived subscriptions are preserved for long-term record-keeping but excluded from totals. Cancelled subscriptions are also excluded.

### Billing day

The `billing_day` column stores the day of month (1–31) when the subscription is billed. If not set, the creation date is used as the anchor for billing calculations. This is particularly relevant for the `upcoming` command, which predicts when your next bill is due.

### Notes & Payment method

The `notes` column stores free-form text notes for a subscription (e.g. "family plan", "shared with friends"). The `payment_method` column records how the subscription is paid (e.g. `credit_card`, `paypal`, `debit_card`).

### Deletion behavior

Deleting a subscription automatically removes its tag associations via `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Orphaned tags (with no subscriptions) can be cleaned up with `subtrack tag prune`.

### Price history

Every time a subscription's price or currency is changed via `subtrack edit`, the previous values are recorded in the `price_history` table. View this history with `subtrack history <id>` or `subtrack history --all`.

### Audit log

All mutating operations (add, edit, delete, clone, archive, import, bulk operations, tag changes, config changes, usage changes) are recorded in the `audit_log` table. View the audit trail with `subtrack audit list` and prune old entries with `subtrack audit prune`.

## Prices are stored as integers

Prices are stored as whole numbers (integers) in the database. This avoids floating-point precision issues. For display, prices are formatted with the appropriate currency symbol and decimal places using `Intl.NumberFormat`.

## Encryption

subtrack automatically encrypts the database file on disk using **AES-256-GCM**. The encryption key is either:

- Auto-generated and stored at `~/.config/subtrack/.key` (on first run)
- Derived from `SUBSC_CLI_DB_PASSPHRASE` environment variable via scrypt

This means your subscription data is encrypted at rest. Backups can also be encrypted with `subtrack backup --encrypt`.

### Key integrity verification

subtrack maintains a SHA-256 integrity hash for the encryption key file at `~/.config/subtrack/.key.sha256`. On every startup, the key's SHA-256 hash is compared against the stored hash:

- **Hash matches** — key is intact, operation proceeds normally
- **No sidecar file** (first run or migration) — sidecar is created automatically
- **Hash mismatch** — an error is shown and the operation is aborted

This detects file corruption and tampering before any encryption/decryption operation. If the integrity check fails, restore the `.key` file from a backup, or delete it to generate a new key (note: this will make encrypted backups unrecoverable).

> ⚠️ **Back up your key file or remember your passphrase.** Without it, the database and encrypted backups cannot be recovered. Consider backing up both `.key` and `.key.sha256` together.

## Backup

Use the `backup` command to create a timestamped copy of your database:

```bash
# Backup to the default directory (~/.config/subtrack/backups/)
subtrack backup
# Creates: ~/.config/subtrack/backups/subtrack_20260617_143000.db.gz

# Backup to a custom directory
subtrack backup ~/backups
# Creates: ~/backups/subtrack_20260617_143000.db.gz

# Encrypted backup
subtrack backup --encrypt
# Creates: ~/.config/subtrack/backups/subtrack_20260617_143000.db.enc
```

If no destination is specified, backups are saved to `~/.config/subtrack/backups/` (created automatically). Backups use exclusive file creation, so they will never overwrite an existing file. Each backup has a SHA-256 hash sidecar (`<backup>.sha256`) for integrity verification. See the [Commands](/commands) reference for full details.

## Restore from backup

Use the `restore` command to restore from a backup. Without arguments, it interactively lists available backups:

```bash
# Interactive: select from available backups
subtrack restore

# Restore from a specific file
subtrack restore ~/backups/subtrack_20260617_143000.db.gz
```

Before restoring, the current database is automatically backed up as a safety measure. You can also restore manually:

```bash
# Stop subtrack (close all running instances)
cp ~/backups/subtrack_20260617_143000.db.gz ~/.config/subtrack/subtrack.db.gz
gunzip -k ~/.config/subtrack/subtrack.db.gz
```

Make sure subtrack is not running when you restore, as changes are written to the database file on every command.

## Custom database directory

Override the default `~/.config/subtrack` directory with the `SUBSC_CLI_DB_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
SUBSC_CLI_DB_DIR=/path/to/custom/dir subtrack list
```

See [Configuration](/configuration) for more details.
